# VoteOn (The Perfect Decentralized Election System on Ethereum)

#### VoteOn offers a secure and transparent solution for modern elections. By harnessing the power of Ethereum's blockchain, this system creates tamper-proof voting records, allowing users to cast votes remotely while ensuring anonymity and preventing fraud. This innovative project represents a step forward in trustworthy, decentralized voting, making it ideal for secure and fair electoral processes.

## Features
- Implements JWT for secure voter authentication and authorization.
- Utilizes Ethereum blockchain for tamper-proof and transparent voting records.
- Removes the need for intermediaries, ensuring a trustless voting process.
- Admin panel to manage candidates, set voting dates, and monitor results.
- Intuitive UI for voters to cast votes and view candidate information.
- Role-based access control for admin and voters.
- Secure login system with password and voter ID.
- Voting period management (start and end dates defined by admin).
- Real-time vote counting and candidate information display.
- Prevention of double voting using blockchain and backend checks.
- Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) enabled for secure API access.
- Environment-based configuration for sensitive data (API keys, DB credentials).
- Responsive and modern UI for both admin and voters.
- Integration with MetaMask for blockchain interactions.
- Error handling and user feedback for all major actions.
